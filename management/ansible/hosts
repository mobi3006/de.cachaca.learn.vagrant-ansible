# WHICH MACHINES ARE MANAGED AND HOW TO ACCESS?
#
# we expect that the private-key to use to access the managed machines reside in
#
#       /home/vagrant/.ssh/private_key_<MACHINE_NAME>
#
# and that these private-keys can be use to ssh-connect for the configured "remote_user" 
# to the managed machines.
# 
# Current Solution:
# We use the private-keys generated by Vagrant for each machine to ssh-connect with user "vagrant".
# Vagrant ensures that these keys can be used to ssh-connect. We use these keys also for ssh-connect
# of user "vagrant" (= configured as remote_user ... see ansible.cfg) from management machine to
# the managed machines.  
#
# Optional Solution:
# Create a public-private-key for the vagrant@management user and ensure that this one is allowed to
# ssh-connect to the managed machines.
